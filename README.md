# DiscordWebhookManager-RUST
Discord webhook manager written in Rust!

# Why I am doing this?
Well, i decided to lean Runst and that's one of the projects i thought of.

# Is it any different than the C one?
Yes, I'm using other libraries and regex URL checking

# GUI version?
I'll probably as well make GUI version in the future but for now it's only CLI!
